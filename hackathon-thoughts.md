# Hackathon Thoughts

## Overall Experience of the Hackathon
### Organizers
As my first hackathon, I can't compare it to others, but I can say the organizers were kind, helpful, and caring. Although I didn't initially think I needed mentoring, one of the mentors provided us with a **HUG** help.     
They went above and beyond by providing food, coffee, and tea, which is pretty cool. I felt only good vibes from them, and their smiles were contagious. I would like to express my gratitude for the great event and their wonderful hospitality. I wish I could have said that to them face-to-face, but hopefully, there's a next year, inshallah :)

### Participant
While I didn't engage in many conversations, I sensed great potential among the participants. Unfortunately, I didn't manage to catch their names, it makes feel sad but well it-is-what-it-is.      
Its my first time to be put in a room with ppl doing what i am doing which is programming, passionate about it as much as I'am, wherever i look i see nerds coding, it made me feel overwhelming happiness.         
Thank you all for being there, contributing to the competition, and I hope to see you again next year. 

### Sleep Deprivation
just one hour in the first 15 hours, and then squeezed in a whopping 3 hours for the rest of the event. I was on full slow-motion mode, but hey, it was surprisingly lovely! XD :)    


### Final Words
The moment I stepped into the building, I felt like a winner. I wasn't concerned about my place on the leaderboard or the competition. All that mattered to me was programming and using my brain to write code.    
I truly enjoyed every bit of it, even if I didn't show it to everyone there. Thanks to the organizers and participants for creating such an incredible experience.
